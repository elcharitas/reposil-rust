# Rustic

> An opinionated numeric interpreter in Rust

Rustic is a simple, opinionated and straightforward interpreted programming language, designed for performing mathematical computations.
It's written in Rust, a systems programming language known for its performance and safety guarantees.
Rustic only accepts `numeric values`, making it a suitable tool for solving mathematical problems with ease.

## Features

-   Only numeric values are accepted as values, making it a language well suited for mathematical computations.
-   Written in Rust, providing excellent performance and safety guarantees.
-   Simple and easy to use syntax, making it a great tool for learning.

## Installation

To use Rustic, you can download the binary from the official repository (`elcharitas/rustic-lang`).
Once you have the binary, you can run it in your terminal.
No other dependencies are required to be installed. Optionally, add it to your path.

## Usage

Once you have the binary, you can run it in your terminal by executing `./rustic -r` to start a REPL.
From there, you can start typing in mathematical expressions, and the result will be displayed on the screen. For example, try running `print 1 + 2` to see the result.
